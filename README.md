Developed a fully functional clone of the popular wandlust platform, replicating core features such as property listings, booking management and user authentication. The project involved designing both the front-end and back-end architecture to simulate the booking experience, allowing users to search, filter, and book accommodations, while hosts can manage their listings and track reservations.

Key Features:

* User Authentication: Implemented sign-up, login, and profile management for both guests and hosts, ensuring secure user sessions and data handling.
* Responsive UI: Designed a user-friendly and responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.
* Backend Development: Built the backend with Node.js and Express, utilizing a MongoDB database for storing user and listing information, bookings, and transaction history.
* Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, RESTful APIs, PayPal API (or Stripe), Git, GitHub, and Heroku for deployment.
